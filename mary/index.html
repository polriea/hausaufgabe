<h1> Kipland Kinkel</h1>
<h3>The most remorseful killer?</h3>

    <p> Kipland Philip "Kip" Kinkel is a spree killer and school shooter who on May 20, 1998, murdered his parents, and then committed a school shooting at his former school, Thurston High, killing two students and wounding twenty-five others.

The shooting at Thurston High was considered the deadliest shooting at an American high school until the April 20, 1999, Columbine High School massacre and later the February 14, 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting (which currently remains the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history).
